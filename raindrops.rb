Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the numberâ€™s factors.

If the number has 3 as a factor, output "Pling".
If the number has 5 as a factor, output "Plang".
If the number has 7 as a factor, output "Plong".
If the number has any combination of those factors, output each (e.g. "PlingPlangPlong" if all three are factors)
If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just print the number.
